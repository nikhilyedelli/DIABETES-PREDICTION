# Diabetes Prediction

This is a machine learning project aimed at predicting the presence of diabetes in patients using health metrics and medical records. The project uses the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm to analyze patient data and make predictions, assisting in early diagnosis and treatment of diabetes.

## Introduction

Diabetes is a chronic health condition affecting millions worldwide. Early detection can greatly improve patient outcomes by allowing timely interventions. This project leverages machine learning, specifically the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model, to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on various health indicators.

## Features

- Predicts diabetes risk based on input health metrics.
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering included.
- SVM model for high-accuracy classification.

## Data

The dataset used for this project can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database), containing data on health metrics such as glucose levels, blood pressure, insulin, BMI, and more.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
